Description:
    The cached page migration generator creates a migration for adding the cached pages tables.

    The generator takes a migration name as its argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.  'add_cached_page' is the default.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate cached_page_migration

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddCachedPage migration in the
    file db/migrate/5_add_cached_page.rb
