* [CHANGED] Changed {{ article.body }} and added {{ article.content }}

  * {{ article.body }} is now always the article's body, regardless of what template is currently being rendered.
  * {{ article.content }} tries to be a little smart.  On sections with multiple articles, it shows the excerpt, or the body if the excerpt is missing.
  Single article templates show the body.

* [NEW] Added {{ article.excerpt }} liquid tag for accessing an articles excerpt.

* Change - Article#body_for_mode only returns the body, not excerpt + body.  This means you'll have to do this in your templates
if you want to show both:

  {{ article.excerpt }}
  {{ article.body }}
